Security features encompass encrypted communication between services, secret management through Consul KV store, network segmentation, and automated security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline. The infrastructure follows security best practices with minimal attack surface and regular updates.

## Architecture

The architecture follows a distributed microservices pattern with clear separation of concerns and robust failure handling mechanisms. The system consists of multiple layers working together to provide a resilient and scalable platform.

### Infrastructure Layer

The infrastructure layer comprises DigitalOcean droplets configured as Nomad and Consul cluster nodes. The primary server (137.184.198.14) serves as the main control plane, while the secondary server (137.184.85.0) provides redundancy and can handle staging workloads. Both servers run Ubuntu 22.04 with Docker, Nomad, and Consul installed and configured for high availability.

Network configuration includes UFW firewall rules allowing necessary ports for Nomad (4646-4648), Consul (8300, 8301, 8302, 8500, 8600), HTTP/HTTPS (80, 443), and SSH (22). The servers communicate over private networking when available, with public IPs used for external access and GitHub Actions deployment.

Storage configuration utilizes local SSD storage for Nomad and Consul data directories, with log rotation configured to prevent disk space issues. Docker volumes provide persistent storage for application data when needed.

### Orchestration Layer

HashiCorp Nomad serves as the primary orchestration platform, managing container lifecycle, resource allocation, and service placement across the cluster. Nomad's scheduler ensures optimal resource utilization while maintaining application availability through intelligent placement decisions.

Consul provides service discovery, configuration management, and service mesh capabilities. Services register automatically with Consul upon deployment, enabling dynamic service discovery and health monitoring. Consul Connect creates secure service-to-service communication through mutual TLS and intention-based access control.

The orchestration layer handles rolling updates, canary deployments, and automatic rollback on failure. Resource constraints and affinity rules ensure proper workload distribution and prevent resource contention.

### Application Layer

Applications run as Docker containers managed by Nomad jobs. Each application includes health check endpoints, metrics exposition, and proper signal handling for graceful shutdowns. The containerized approach ensures consistency across environments and simplifies dependency management.

Load balancing occurs through Traefik, which integrates with Consul for automatic service discovery and configuration. Traefik handles SSL termination, request routing, and provides advanced features like rate limiting and circuit breakers.

Application logs are collected and aggregated through structured logging, with centralized log management for troubleshooting and audit purposes. Metrics are exposed in Prometheus format for monitoring and alerting.

### CI/CD Layer
